This is a simple example of passing values from C++ to Python and back using the Python/C-API

In this directory you can run 

cmake .
make

to build the PyCall executable. Run the executable with the command line argument

./PyCall add x y
./PyCall times x y

where x and y are two numbers and the functions defined in numerics.py will be called
to evaluate the result and return it.
